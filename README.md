# WhatsAppText2Emoji
A simple script that converts good old text smileys to fancy new emojis :heart:

## Installation
### Installing required browser extensions
You need to have tampermonkey / greasemonkey or some other way to install userscripts in order to run this, so make sure you have your extensions ready before installing

* [Install Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
* [Install Greasemonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
 
### Installing the script
[Click here to install](https://github.com/vaibhav-y/WhatsAppText2Emoji/raw/master/whatsapp_text2emoji.user.js)

## Notes
I've only tested this on Google Chrome for Windows (Version 52.0.2743.82 m), but it should work on all major browsers that support userscripts.

## Contribute!
